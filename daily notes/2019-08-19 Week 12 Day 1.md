@here please fork this week's repo  

PMML - Predictive Model Markup Lang (older method)  
Serialization - has the ability to be open, used and then closed; scorer is not required  
Model Services: Sagemake AWS, ML Studio Azure  

Flask - Web dev microframework - in DS we use it for creating an API (expose endpoints to data)  

**Why do we use it?**    
1. simple to learn, extensively scalable  
2. not scaffolded - less dep and can do what want  
3. growing and active community  

**Flask concents related to DS**    
app - running as a service on a specific port  
routes - pages or areas within the app  
request - GET/POST to/from the app  

> $pip install Flask  
> $FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run  
> $sudo nano new_app.py  
> $python new_app.py

```
from flask import Flask # instantiate the class  
app = Flask(__name__) # create an instance of Flask   
 
@app.route("/") # webpage (endpoint, where data will go)  
def helloworld():
    return "Hello world!" 

if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run()   
```   
```
from flask import Flask # instantiate the class  
app = Flask(__name__) # create an instance of Flask  

@app.route('/')
def home():   
    # there has to be a folder called 'templates' to store the html files  
    return render_template('home.html')  
    
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')   
    
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run()  
```

API - application programming interface  
1. access to a larger stack - twitter, facebook  
2. access to a data source from some service  
snowpipe  
nifi - apache  
3. middleware - used for sending/receiving information
