“We have effectively copied the price column into the feature set, kind of like studying for a quiz by looking at the answers. This is a form of data leakage …”

One of my highlights of 2018 was getting to gather with all the Ryan's of @LambdaSchool IRL.  
One was keen enough to make this all star diagram so that we all know, which Ryan is which.  
@Ryan_Holdaway @rrherr @ryanallred Here is to a marvelous 2019 working with one another! :clinking_glasses:   https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvzKE7IVsAA1XX5.jpg

DEMYSTIFY SQL AND RELATIONAL DATABASES WITH THIS COSMIC DETECTIVE STORY   

I think these are some of the best definitions I’ve seen. But I’m not in 100% agreement. I think sometimes, yes, ML Engineer means “build and deploy ML”, but sometimes ML Engineer means “devops for ML” (synonymous with ML Infra Engineer).

I still see a lot of confusion around data titles:  
data engineer = build pipelines  
data analyst = decision analytics  
ml engineer = build and deploy ML  
ml infra engineer = devops for ML  
ml scientist = research & publish ML  
Data scientists could be analysts or ml engineers

I’ve carved out this little niche for myself on the internet as an inventor of useless machines, because as we all know, the easiest way to be at the top of your field is to choose a very small field.

Transcript of "Why you should make useless things"  
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this joyful, heartfelt talk featuring demos of her wonderfully wacky creations, Simone Giertz shares her craft: making useless robots. Her inventions -- designed to chop vegetables, cut hair, apply lipstick and more -- rarely (if ever) succeed, and that's the point. "The true beauty of making useless things [is] this acknowledgment that you don't always know what the best answer is," Giertz says. "It turns off that voice in your head that tells you that you know exactly how the world works. Maybe a toothbrush helmet isn't the answer, but at least you're asking the question."

These are also good definitions of Data/ML roles, with more concrete examples: https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c

Your data model has a complex set of base tables. From those base tables you create a clean, well documented, denormalized, wide table from which can quickly build analyses off of. For example: a table with every sale and accompanying details.  
What is that table called?
