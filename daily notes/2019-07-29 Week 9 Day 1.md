@channel I added detailed instructions here for getting started:   
https://github.com/rrherr/dash-template/blob/master/README.md  

I will add much more written instructions. (For example, how to change app name in browser title bar, how to change app name in navbar, how to change your name and contact info/social media links in the footer, how to change the “bootswatch” theme, how to change the text on the home page, etc.)
I’ll let you know when I have more updates, and I look forward to more hands-on Plotly Dash demos tomorrow morning at 8am Pacific!

>Given the similarities between conda and pip, it is not surprising that some try to combine these tools to create data science environments. A major reason for combining pip with conda is when one or more packages are only available to install via pip. Over 1,500 packages are available in the Anaconda repository, including the most popular data science, machine learning, and AI frameworks. These, along with thousands of additional packages available on Anaconda cloud from channeling including conda-forge and bioconda, can be installed using conda. Despite this large collection of packages, it is still small compared to the over 150,000 packages available on PyPI. Occasionally a package is needed which is not available as a conda package but is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip. In these cases, it makes sense to try to use both conda and pip.

2. What are you most passionate about/best at in your current field?  
3. What soft skills have been most helpful/relevant to you as you have learned skills for your current field?  
4. What are you most excited for next? Focus on the things that add value to others- you might be most excited for your first paycheck, but pick one or two things that you would want to hear from a candidate you were interested in hiring for your team.
