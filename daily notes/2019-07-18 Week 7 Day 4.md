@here For the Sprint Challenge, you’ll demonstrate mastery on these objectives:  

- do train/validate/test split  
- begin with baselines for classification  
- do ordinal encoding or one-hot encoding  
- do feature engineering  
- use scikit-learn for random forests (or decision trees, or logistic regression)  
- get feature importances of a tree-based model (or coefficients of a logistic regression)  
- calculate accuracy, precision, and recall from a confusion matrix  

Ryan Herr [9:23 AM]  
@here Today’s lesson includes two new libraries. If you use Google Colab, these are already installed. If you work locally, you will probably want to install them:  

1. mlxtend (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) to plot decision regions  
- Local Anaconda: `conda install -c conda-forge mlxtend`  

2. tqdm (https://tqdm.github.io/) for progress bars  
- Local Anaconda: `conda install -c conda-forge tqdm`   

Ryan Herr [9:28 AM]  
If you’ve logged on early and you want to skim some good reads before the lesson, I recommend these:  
*1.* ROC curves and Area Under the Curve explained (https://www.dataschool.io/roc-curves-and-auc-explained/)  
*2.* Learning from Imbalanced Classes (https://www.svds.com/tbt-learning-imbalanced-classes/)
