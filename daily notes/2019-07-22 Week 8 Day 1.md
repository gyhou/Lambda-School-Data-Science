Had a few people ping me on this already, so I figured I’d post it here. If you’re seeing any random issues pushing or pulling from GitHub (especially 500 errors or fatal errors in commit_refs) it’s a status issue with GitHub itself.

When everything goes green you should be all set, but for now it’s gonna be a bit rough.  

brief exercise in desmos if you have very little calculus background: what constants `a,b,m,l` make the red line equal the blue line?

Hi @channel, thanks for joining today! If you want more on cold outreach, please also watch Jeff Henriod’s presentation on cold outreach. Jeff is Director of Partnerships at Lambda School, so he does this a lot! Recording here:

Cold Outreach 

FOR FRIDAY, please complete the following:  

:one: Send at least three cold outreach messages to someone on LinkedIn (or via email if you have their email addresses)  
- Links to templates and resources to get you started are in thread  
- Submit screenshots of your outreach messages to your PM on Friday  

:two:  Identify three upcoming networking events that you can attend over the next month or two. If you live in an area without many events like this, then instead join three online groups relevant to your field and interests and post an introduction.  
- Links to templates and resources to get you started are in thread  
- Submit screenshots of your event RSVPs or your group posts to your PM on Friday.  

Additional resources to help with all of the above in thread!
