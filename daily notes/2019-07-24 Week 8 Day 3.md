@channel Today’s notebook is in the Github repo:   
https://github.com/LambdaSchool/DS-Unit-2-Applied-Modeling/tree/master/module3-hyperparamter-optimization    
You can follow along live with me on Google Colab:   
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gfA04X4y_ShdXDIXAaCEFb1wn7Rd0zUl  
I’m teaching with Colab for your convenience. But I recommend that you work locally today! Hyperparameter optimization & cross-validation with the Caterpillar dataset does work on Colab, but it’s slow.

I need to figure out how to do a custom eval_metric  
Here’s some links about using other evaluation metrics with gradient boosting. (This is an advanced topic! But it’s powerful to be able to use custom metrics aligned to your domain & problem.)

replied to a thread:  
would have to write a class w/ fit and transform methods to shove into pipeline, no?  
Here’s some code from a DS4 student for a related goal, using the eval_set parameter for xgboost early stopping, within a complete scikit-learn pipeline:  
```
class XGRegressorEval(XGBRegressor):
  def fit(self, *args, **kwargs):
    return super().fit(*args, eval_set=eval_set, eval_metric='rmse', 
          early_stopping_rounds=10, **kwargs)
    
pipeline = make_pipeline(ce.OrdinalEncoder(), XGRegressorEval(n_estimators=1000, n_jobs=-1))
```

@channel by tyranny of the majority, we are pairprogramming this morning. Hop on into zoom

The Poisson distribution may be useful to model events such as the number of patients arriving in an emergency room between 10 and 11 pm

Poisson distribution  
In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution, named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.  

Quinn:lambda-pm: 3:35 PM  
followup to the montecarlo question from this morning: any distribution in scipy.stats implements an  rvs method that simulates "drawing" from a random variable with that distribution. so if scipy.stats implemented d6, an ordinary 6 sided die, a call to d6.rvs() would be like "throwing" the die.  
conveniently, an rvs method has a size parameter, so a monte carlo simulation of 1000 draws from a poisson-distributed random variable is simply `poisson.rvs(4, size=1000)`  
Crucially, you need to know the difference between a pmf and a random variable. a pmf just states what the probability of observing a value is, it doesn't actually produce the value

@channel By Friday, July 26, 5pm Pacific, choose your dataset for your personal project, and submit this form with your dataset’s URL:  
https://forms.gle/X1GbH475D5yYKTdr9  
You should probably get this done by end of day Thursday, because you’ll be busy with your Sprint Challenge on Friday. To help the project go smoothly for you, me, and our Team Leads, please submit your form as soon as you can. Thanks so much!
