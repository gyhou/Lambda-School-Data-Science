【Demonstrate Mastery】
To demonstrate mastery of this module, you need to complete and pass a code review on each of the following:

    Objective challenge:
        Add a route that reports the overall goodness of fit of the logistic regression (e.g. clf.score(X, y)).
        Add a route that takes as a parameter the input data to be predicted, and returns class labels (or even full probabilities).
        Refactor! You should probably centralize and move the actual scikit logic to another file, and have your routing file just import and use what it needs.
        
    Objective challenge:
        The above example shows how to save and load an arbitrary Python object with pickle.
        Reproduce the example, but with your own Python object (and specifically one representing a statistical model of some sort).
        Persist the string into a file or database, and write code to automatically load it in a fresh session.
        See if you can integrate the above into your web application!
```

**Pickling**    
serialization - serialize and un-serialize objects (models) in python  

**what can i do with it**  
1. persistence (careful with DS) - model maintenance  
2. store a state to disk  

**when do i use it**  
1. use multiple language - don't use pickle  
2. some people prefer JSON (PMML)  
3. what can we pickle?  

```
import pickle
mylist = [i for i in range(5)]
print(mylist)
path = 'list_pickle2.pkl'
list_pickle = open(path, 'wb')  # write binary mode 
pickle.dump(mylist, list_pickle)
list_pickle.close()  

# open the pkl file and use it
mylist_unpickle = open(path, 'rb') # read binary mode
print(mylist_unpickle)
mylist2 = pickle.load(mylist_unpickle)
print(mylist2)
```

```
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
```

```
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request  

url = "http://localhost:9000/api"

@app.route('/api', methods=['POST'])
def pred():
    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    ...
```

1. We offer great flexibility in our employees' scheduling? What would your ideal work week look like?
2. You are at a charity event and have purchased 1 ticket for a raffle. Prior to the drawing, you are told that there are 200 people at the event (including yourself), and about 3/4 of the people at the event purchased tickets to the raffle. Of those people, equal numbers of people purchased 1, 2, and 3 tickets, respectively. Based on these estimations, and assuming only one winner, what is the probability that you win the raffle?
3. When do you expect human-level AGI to be developed and why? 
4. What about our company excites you the most? (assume it is a company in a field you are NOT excited about)
5. What would you do if a teammate changed your work without consulting you first?
6. What was your biggest achievement in your last job?
7. Do you prefer working in a team or alone? Why?
8. What are two or three specific applications of data science that get you most excited?
9. Justin is taking out balls one by one from a box which contains 6 red balls and 5 blue balls. After he takes out a ball, he doesn't put it back in the box. After he takes out 3 balls from the box, he checks their colors: 2 red and 1 blue. What is the probability that the first ball he took out was red? (⅔)
```

```
p1 = 6/11 * 5/10 * 5/9  
p2 = 5/11 * 6/10 * 5/9  
p = p1 * 2/3 / ( p1 * 2/3 + p2 * 1/3)   
(p1=p2, hence p=2/3)
```
