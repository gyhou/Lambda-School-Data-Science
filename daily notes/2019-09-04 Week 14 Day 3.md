Assignment This Afternoon  
Work with your  TL Group to achieve 96-97% accuracy on the competition.  
Mechanics:  
- You should merge individuals / teams together on Kaggle using the "Team" tab on the Which Whisky competition page
- After lunch, start a group zoom session to collaborate on a notebook
- I recommend using version control on your submissions (ie commit the notebook every time you make a submission).
Some ideas for improvements:
- There are only a handful of words that determine which category a whiskey falls into
- Try more than 1 modeling technique
- Cheat :wink:

    tokens = []
    
    # You can extract anything you want from Spacy to use as a feature
    # Noun Chunks aren't the end all be all. 
    # Try Extracting just tokens, or just adjectives, or just pronouns
    
    for chunk in d.noun_chunks:
        tokens.append(chunk.lemma_)
        
    return tokens

Good morning! thank you for interviewing at Corporation. We have a few standard questions to see if you're a good fit on our teams here.  
1. How would you explain a 95% confidence interval to an executive with no statistics background?   
2. What is a t-test?   
3. What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors?   
4. You don't have a Phd. or a degree in a requisite field. Why should we hire you?  
5. What is pipelining and how might you build one in Python?  
6. does python have a built in function to take `[1,2,3]` and `['a', 'b', 'c']`returning `[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]`?   
7. analyzing a dozen documents of natural language, your team finds that the word `the` appears in all of the documents. is this useful information? did your team forget to do a step?  
8. What are the ML concepts covered at Lambda School?  
9. What are the disadvantages of an interpreted language?
