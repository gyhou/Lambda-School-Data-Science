@channel I updated the dash-template README with more instructions, including how to:  
- Add & remove pages  
- Add images  
- Add scikit-learn pipelines  
https://github.com/rrherr/dash-template/blob/master/README.md  
I’ll drop a Zoom link in 5 minutes to demonstrate these step-by-step. (Will be recorded. Attendance optional, but encouraged if you want to make a Dash app.)

@channel I added instructions for how to deploy your app to Heroku:   
https://github.com/rrherr/dash-template/blob/master/README.md#deploy-to-heroku  
Here’s the first 3 steps. I recommend you do these now!  
1. Watch [DS - Data Engineering - Productization and Cloud - Web Application Deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W75JAe7vFF0) (12 minute video from Training Kit).  
2. Sign up for Heroku at https://signup.heroku.com/ for a free account.  
If you are registered with the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you are eligible to receive one free Hobby Dyno for up to 2 years (valued at $84/year). (App never sleeps) — https://www.heroku.com/github-students  
3. Download and install Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
