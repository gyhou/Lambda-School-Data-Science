@channel Today's walkie talkie.    
https://lambdaschool.zoom.us/j/8593527401    
Thank you for accepting this assignment as a Data Science Consultant.  Our business sells car insurance. We buy google search ads to display to users who search for car insurance topics on Google. We also bid on leads, which are websites selling some information about who visited the website. We then call our leads and offer them our services. You have the freedom to iterate and AB test.
1. We need to create data science models to set the amount of $$ we should bid on a lead. Your info will be the demographics about who visits the websites or searches (i.e. age, zip code, device, etc.)  
2. We need to be quick, since most of the bidding takes places in milliseconds.  
3. We need to examine and explain what we are doing and how the models work to management.  
Questions  
What data science models do you think would work best for our business?  
How are you going to measure success of models or experiments?
