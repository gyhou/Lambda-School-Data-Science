**Walkie Talkie**  

@here please make sure your package lambdata-firstnamelastname is pushed as a github repo in advance of this morning's walkie talkie activity   

Quinn:lambda-pm: 09:59  
@channel for today's walkie talkie, you'll review a peer's code. The code we'll be reviewing will be last week's lambdata module.
answer the following questions  
1. does the code follow PEP8?   
2. are comments adequate, does every function or class have a docstring?  
3. are variable names sensible and do they help the reader figure out what's going on?  
4. would you use this module?  

please make your own fork of your peer's repository and provide edits to make it closer to an answer of YES in each of the four questions. Then, commit your edits and submit a pull request.    
Hop on in https://lambdaschool.zoom.us/j/8593527401
