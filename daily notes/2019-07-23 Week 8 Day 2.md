2. I’d love to get some volunteer(s) to share their Caterpillar data wrangling during today’s lesson. Let me know here or by DM, thanks!

@channel Goob Morning. today on repl. it is interleave, a function from two lists to one list.  
If you have a solution by 845, and you'd like to share, DM me.  
otherwise, i'll be providing solution.

replied to a thread:  
is there a method like .keys() but for key/value pairs?  
.items()

=================================================  

Ryan Herr:lambda-red: 2:56 PM    
@channel To prepare for tomorrow’s lesson, please read:    
Python Data Science Handbook, Chapter 5.3, Hyperparameters and Model Validation.  
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.03-hyperparameters-and-model-validation.html  
This subchapter has diagrams we looked at during today’s lesson. It discusses cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, which are the objectives for tomorrow’s lesson.  
This also introduces “the bias-variance trade-off.” Which Han mentioned, “seems to be a popular question for technical ml interviews”

OPTIONAL BONUS: Read A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning.    
https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf    
You can ⌘+f for “bias” and “variance”

@channel By Friday, July 26, 5pm Pacific, choose your dataset for your personal project, and submit this form with your dataset’s URL: https://forms.gle/X1GbH475D5yYKTdr9    
You should probably get this done by end of day Thursday, because you’ll be busy with your Sprint Challenge on Friday. To help the project go smoothly for you, me, and our Team Leads, please submit your form as soon as you can. Thanks so much!
