Print debugging is absolutely a fine approach - and if over time you want to get a bit fancier:  
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html - slightly more logic around logging different types of situations  
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html - debugger - put break points and drop into a repl within the context of your running application to interactively debug

The other pragmatic advice I have, based on what we’ve learned so far: Do everything from your virtual environment, including launching Jupyter Notebook. Prototype everything that you can in Jupyter, and when it’s working there, then integrate it into your Dash app. Because you have more experience working in notebooks and because working in a “REPL” is nice for debugging and prototyping
