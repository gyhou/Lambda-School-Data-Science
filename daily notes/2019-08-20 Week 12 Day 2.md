you can work around it with this     
https://github.com/bisguzar/twitter-scraper    

=======================================

API is not a database nor a server; it is the code that governs teh access points for the server  
secure access - e.g. controlled by access and auth keys  
open access - usually requires nothing to access  

JSON - Javascript Object Notation  
1. collecion of name/value pairs
2. ordered list of values  

**request**  
   
> $pip install requests
```
import requests
import json

url1 = "https://api.weatherbit.io/"
url2 = "http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json"
response = requests.get(url2)
print(response)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.text)
print(response.content)

params = {'lat': 33.768, 'lon':-84.474}
response = request.get(url2, params=params)
```

Response Codes  
200 - connection was made - all good  
301 - redirected to different endpoint  
401 - bad request  
403 - access is forbidden  
404 - resource not found   

JSON - dumps and loads   
handle info for the response data  
for the browser  
overall goal  
get it to text or a derivative of text

recall from the "complete before lecture" portion of today's lecture notes:  
`
Sign up for Twitter Developer access - this requires answering various questions about what you will use the API for. Answer honestly, mentioning that you are a student and will be developing an application that analyzes the textual content of Tweets for comparing different Twitter users. Also check out Tweepy, a Python package that facilitates accessing the Twitter API.`

recommended text to submit when signing up for twitter api-- past cohorts have reported that this tends to work most often:  
`
I am a student at Lambda School, and my core use case is using the Twitter API to follow along with a lesson on how to use APIs. I do not intend to analyze Tweets, Twitter users, or their content. I do not plan to tweet, retweet, or like content. I do not plan to display Twitter content off of Twitter.

**Code Challenge**

```
def compress(s):
  assert isinstance(s, str), "Error: Input not String"
  assert isinstance(s[0], str), "Error: Number in String"
    
  #letters = list(set(s))
  seen = set()
  letters = [x for x in s if x not in seen and not seen.add(x)]
  if len(letters) == len(s):
    return s
  
  #result = [[str(s.count(l)), l] for l in letters ]
  #result = [''.join(r) for r in result]
  result = []
  j = 1
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if (i < len(s) -1) and (s[i+1] != s[i]):
      result.append(str(j)+s[i])
      j = 1
    elif (i == len(s)-1):
      print("here")
      result.append(str(j)+s[i])
      j = 1
    else:
      j += 1
  result = ''.join(result)
  
  if len(s) <= len(result):
    return s
  else:
    return result
```

Nayomi Chibana 11:00
```
from itertools import groupby

def compress(s):
  groups = groupby(s)
  result = [(label, sum(1 for _ in group)) for label, group in groups]
  results = [item[::-1] for item in result]
  p = [item for sublist in results for item in sublist]
  f = ''.join(str(e) for e in p)
  if len(f) < len(s):
    return f
  else:
    return s
```

**CAUTION**    
MapReduce - This is for a different scenario.  
```
from functools import reduce

def reducer(i, j):
    for k in j: i[k] = i.get(k, 0) + j.get(k, 0)
    return i

def count(string):
    return reduce(reducer, map(lambda char: dict([[char, 1]]), string))

def compress(string):
    d = count(string)
    if len(d) == len(string):
        return string
    return ''.join([str(v)+k for k,v in d.items()])
```

Hello Students
Welcome to yet another Build Sprint, or welcome for the first time! As we kick off the upcoming build sprint I wanted to cover a few items that will make your life a lot easier this time around:
1.) Introducing the Draft Day sign up process. :memo:
    How this works is youâ€™ll tell us what products youâ€™ll be interested in working on, and your SL will draft you to a product team. It truly is as simple as that. TLâ€™s donâ€™t even need to sweat
2.) Welcome back Project Leads! :female-cook:
    I know we caused quite a bit of anxiety when we took Team Leads away from projects during a Build Sprint. Now your very own TL will be signed up to be a project lead and work on ensuring you have what you need to get the ball rolling and get you unstuck when you get there.
3.) Kick off is this Friday at 1pm PDT. ðŸ¥¾
      Be there to get a run down of all of tasks for that day and an overview of the documentation for the sprint.
4.) No more Monday.com (youâ€™re welcome ;D )
      :dancer::skin-tone-4:
Here is the list of products you can choose from: 
https://airtable.com/shrTu9WiPg1hCIpob
Here is the sign up form. PLEASE FILL THIS OUT BEFORE FRIDAY MORNING:
