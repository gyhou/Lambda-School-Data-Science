Hi @channel, Time to talk all things Interviews: What to expect, How to prepare, STAR/FEB Methods, and more.  

Rachel Cohen:lambda-staff2: 10:48   
Great spending Monday morning with you all, as always! FOR FRIDAY:   
You have options depending on your familiarity and comfort level with interviewing; please complete the assignment that is the best match for you!
:small_blue_diamond: If you are a very nervous interviewer or have limited experience:   
- Complete the STAR & Common Interview Questions worksheet (linked below) with general responses that could apply to a range of technical work settings. Submit on Friday.
- BONUS: practice answering these questions aloud, and extra bonus, film yourself doing it! You don’t need to submit this, but it’s a great way to build your comfort level talking about your skills.
:small_blue_diamond: If you are familiar with STAR/FEB but want to build your confidence relating your past experience to technical roles:
- Find a job description that you are fairly qualified for (you meet 50%-80% of the requirements), go through the mapping process we just did together, and write out responses in the STAR worksheet (linked below) that are specifically tailored to that role. Submit on Friday, and be sure to include a link to the description in your STAR worksheet.
- BONUS: practice answering these questions aloud, and extra bonus, film yourself doing it! You don’t need to submit this, but it’s a great way to build your comfort level talking about your skills.
STAR WORKSHEET: you will need to make a copy and save to your Google drive to edit

@channel AWS Credits are Coming  
:aws::awesome: :aws::awesome: :aws::awesome: :aws::awesome: :aws::awesome:  
It's unlikely you will have the credits during build week - let me clear that upfront. :sadcat:
1. You need to sign-up for AWS https://aws.amazon.com/  
2. You need to fill out the AWS Activate Application:   
-  https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup/  
- Fill in your name and email as you used for AWS signup  
- Find your AWS account ID - it should be a 12-digit number in your AWS Console -> Account Settings  
- For AWS Account Company Name, use firstname_lastname  
- For startup URL, use your professional portfolio URL  
- Same phone/address as you used before (though full address is optional)  
- Industry "Education"  
- Organization ID (case sensitive!): 0qrBs (for LSDS use only - please don't share with others)  
3. Share the email address associated with your AWS account with your SL (@Quinn Dougherty)    
:aws::awesome: :aws::awesome: :aws::awesome: :aws::awesome: :aws::awesome:  
Important Note: Amazon graciously provides you with $1500 in credits, but Lambda / AWS cannot guarantee  additional credits  if you use all your credits. Just be careful, please.  
P.S.: Looking forward to having you in Unit 4. :smiley: :brain:
