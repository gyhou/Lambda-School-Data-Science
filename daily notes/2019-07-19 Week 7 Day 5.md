### Feature Engineering

DM your Team Lead and ask for the Sprint Challenge solution video. It includes the feature engineering stretch goals.

Look at Kaggle Kernels (notebooks) for feature engineering examples. Here’s a 10 part series of kernels by Will Koehrsen, about the Home Credit Default Risk competition. The series includes _Manual Feature Engineering Part One, Manual Feature Engineering Part Two, Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering, Advanced Automated Feature Engineering, & Feature Selection._

Jake VanderPlas has a great feature engineering example for predicting bicycle traffic, in Chapter 5.6 of _Python Data Science Handbook_.

I’ve only read the 1st chapter and Table of Contents so far, but this looks like the book I’ve been looking for! _Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models,_ by Max Kuhn & Kjell Johnson. These are the same authors who wrote _Applied Predictive Modeling_ and created the R package “caret.”

Here’s a list of some generic feature transformations to try. This comes from the docs for H2O’s AutoML products, but H2O isn’t required. You could do these manually with pandas or other tools if you want.

The Featuretools library does automated feature engineering and has 10 end-to-end demos for real-world use cases:

I’d like to read _Advances in Financial Machine Learning_ by Marcos Lopez de Prado, although it may be too specialized and advanced for me. Part 4 is on “Useful Financial Features.”
