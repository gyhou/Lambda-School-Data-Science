@channel If you’ve logged on early and you want to skim some good reads before the lesson, I recommend these:  
*1.* Precision and Recall — _just the diagram and first 4 paragraphs_  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall  
*2.* Simple guide to confusion matrix terminology   
https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/  
*3.* My notebook with a short scenario about how to define targets and choose evaluation metrics to make real-world decisions and take action: to go from predictive models to prescriptive recommendations.   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XLxPAw7LQDDTV8ckdvWdkroNsJ6CBSnO

Or, you can look at these after the lesson. Thanks, looking forward to it!
