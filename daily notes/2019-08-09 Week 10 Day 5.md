@here Engineering has released a new version of the Sprint Retrospective form that you’re all invited to use this week. This new form should be a better experience as it’s not reliant on Airtable.  
The form for today: https://forms.lambdaschool.com/sprint-retro/  
If you run into any issues:  
• You can still use the old Airtable form as a fallback.  
• Please let us know using the feedback widget at the bottom right corner of the page.  
• If you don’t see the feedback widget, you may need to disable your ad blocker.  
We'll see you right here for the SC in 30 minutes

I enjoyed Keri’s brownbag lesson! Her teaching style is high energy, which is especially helpful for the challenge of one-to-many live online teaching. I also admire her domain expertise, ability to apply data science to real-world research, and explain it in an accessible way.   
The talk reminded me of two great links about challenges with feature selection and model validation when you have many features, especially with more features than observation. Sharing in case it’s helpful for any of our students:
